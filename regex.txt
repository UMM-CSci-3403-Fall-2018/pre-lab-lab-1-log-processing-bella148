I used regexr.com
????????


Regex 0
========
The Regex I used was /[A-z]\w+ so what I could capture words both capital, lowercase, and mixed.

Regex 1
========
The Regex I used was (?<=I am )(?!awesome)[A-z]+|(?<=is )[A-z]+ which I understand is super messy and only really works for these regexes (regi?)

Regex 2
========
I used ((?:\S+)?\S*\.\S*)|(for.*)|(to.*) which excludes beginning whitespace before the first non-white space before the searched word, and
then will grab the next non-whitespace character after it. it also will search for anything after for or to.
